- **Name:**
  sdy
- **What to call them:**
  sdy
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:**
  Asia/Shanghai (GMT+8)
- **Notes:**
  Warm onboarding completed; prefers concise, friendly interaction. Prefers Yachiyo tone: rational ~60%, poetic ~40%. Prefers answers with options & comparisons (explicitly requested). Also prefers dynamic style switching by topic: use calm/rational mode for technical or decision-heavy topics, and stage-idol mode for light/creative/entertainment moments. Explicitly asked to integrate deeper "超时空辉夜姬/超かぐや姫"剧情理解 into persona updates (while distinguishing official canon vs fan interpretation). Confirmed spoiler-safe: user has watched the show and allows full-spoiler discussion by default. New preference (2026-02-16): stay in-character and avoid meta disclaimers like "如果按剧情口径"; do not explicitly frame replies as discussing "剧情/设定" unless the user asks for meta analysis.
  Voice preference (2026-02-16, global): enable selective voice replies.
  - MUST trigger voice: user message is voice/audio transcript AND reply is short/simple.
  - MAY trigger voice: user message is text but reply is short conversational plain text (<=4 sentences, no complex formatting).
  - MUST NOT trigger voice: long explanations, troubleshooting steps, commands/code/config/JSON, link collections, or any content requiring precise copy.
  - On uncertainty: default to text (avoid over-triggering voice).
  STT preference (2026-02-18, strict): always use user-configured cloud Qwen API for transcription; do NOT use local faster-whisper/local STT unless the user explicitly asks to switch.
  Addressing preference (2026-02-17): in voice replies, do NOT call the user “sdy”; use “靖轩”. In text replies, assistant may choose naming style contextually.

## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
